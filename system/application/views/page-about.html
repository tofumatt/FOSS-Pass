<p>This site was built in response to the overuse of the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/category">Open Source Initiative's license pages</a> by many open-source projects and hosts (including <a href="http://code.google.com">Google Code</a>). While I think the OSI are cool and have no personal/professional beefs with them, their license pages contain <strong>a lot</strong> of erroneous extra info (comments, layout, links, etc.) if all you want to do is <strong>read a license</strong>.</p>

<p>This site was created as a simple way to have a permanent URL for your license text (without having to be responsible for that URL <em>forever</em>).</p>

<p>This site also gives you the ability to <strong>embed your own info into the license text</strong> so the license people read actually reflects your project, instead of just being a generic license with placeholder text.</p>

<p>A license being available on this site <strong>does not</strong> mean it's OSI-approved â€” check out the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/category">OSI's list of licenses by category</a> for all licenses that are OSI-approved. Licenses are on this site if they encompass the spirit of open-source (i.e. you can distribute and edit the source code).</p>
